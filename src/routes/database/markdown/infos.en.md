The _Musikverein Database_ offers a powerful search feature to help you explore its extensive collection of historical events, particularly between 1860 and 1900 in Münster. The data is sourced from [musiconn.performance](https://performance.musiconn.de/).

- **Person**: Find entries related to specific individuals, such as composers or performers.
- **Work** (Composition): Locate events tied to particular musical works.
- **Corporation**: Explore organizations or institutions associated with the database.
- **Location**: Discover events linked to specific places.

## How to Use

1. Search Bar: Enter your query (e.g., "Beethoven" or "Münster") in the search bar at the top.
2. Filters: Narrow results by category for more precise exploration. Filters can be configured as follows:

   - **AND**: Display events that match all selected criteria.<br/> For example, if two composers are added to the filter with "AND," only events involving both composers will appear.
   - **OR**: Display events that match at least one selected criterion.<br/> For example, if two composers are added to the filter with "OR," events involving either or both composers will appear.
   - **NOT**: Exclude events matching the selected criteria.
